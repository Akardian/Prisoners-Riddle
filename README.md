# Prisoners-Riddle

## Rules

- 100 prisoners numbered 1-100.
- Slips with their numbers are randomly placed in 100 boxes in a room.
- Each prisoner may enter the room one at a time and check 50 boxes.
- They must leave the room exectly as tehey found it and can't communicate with the others after.
- If all 100 prisoners find their number during their turn in the room they will all be freed. 
Bit if even one fails, they will all be executed.
